# Find-the-best-matching-pet
I won the overall winner award in the 2023 Yhack hackathon competition! 

<h1>The web app I created</h1>
The theme of the Yhack this year was "identity" and "AI". I created a fun and quick facial recognition web app.
This is an app that allows users to upload a photo of themselves and then analyze the photo to show them which pet would be the best fit for them. 
Based on the results, the AI robot will tell you the two best things about the pet and three tips to prepare before welcoming it into the family. 

<h3>I thought this was a good fit for the themes of this Yhack, "Identity" and "AI"</h3>
1. Nowadays, pets are not just animals, they have a bigger meaning and help many people to learn about happiness and pleasure. Pets are people's best friends and family members. Therefore, pets are grateful friends who help people realize their identity.
2. Many people grow up with pets from a young age. They learn to be responsible, learn to love others and learn to respect others. That is why pets help people learn their identity.  
3. we had to train the model to recognize and analyze faces and use OpenAI to generate answers based on the results. These two characteristics give users the opportunity to interact with AI beyond just having fun.
4. and this is just fun! We don't have to be so serious about identity. Sometimes the chance to have a little fun and be happy can be the thing that keeps our own healthy identity.
