# Find-the-best-matching-pet
I won the overall winner award in the 2023 Yhack hackathon competition! 

<h1>The web app I created</h1>
The theme of the Yhack this year was "identity" and "AI". I created a fun and quick facial recognition web app. 
Apps that recognize faces and analyze facial shapes have been popular in Korea since smartphones first became popular. 
However, after living in the United States for five years, I didn't see many people talking about these kinds of apps, 
so I wondered how I could introduce them to people in a friendly way. I remembered that many people in the U.S. have pets and treat 
them like family members, so I thought they would be interested in an app that would show them which pet would be the best match 
based on the user's face shape. This is an app that allows users to upload a photo of themselves and then analyze the photo to show
them which pet would be the best fit for them. Based on the results, the AI robot will tell you the two best things about the pet and 
three tips to prepare before welcoming it into the family. 

<h2>The reasons this app is a good fit for the themes of this Yhack, "Identity" and "AI"</h2>
<p>1. Nowadays, pets are not just animals, they have a bigger meaning and help many people to learn about happiness and pleasure. Pets are people's best friends and family members. Therefore, pets are grateful friends who help people realize their identity.</p>
<p>2. Many people grow up with pets from a young age. They learn to be responsible, learn to love others and learn to respect others. That is why pets help people learn their identity.</p>  
<p>3. we had to train the model to recognize and analyze faces and use OpenAI to generate answers based on the results. These two characteristics give users the opportunity to interact with AI beyond just having fun.</p>
<p>4. and this is just fun! We don't have to be so serious about identity. Sometimes the chance to have a little fun and be happy can be the thing that keeps our own healthy identity.</p>
