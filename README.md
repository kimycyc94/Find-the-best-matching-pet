# Find-the-best-matching-pet
I won the overall winner award in the 2023 Yhack hackathon competition! 

<h1>The web app I created</h1>
The theme of the Yhack this year was "identity" and "AI". I created a fun and quick facial recognition web app.
This is an app that allows users to upload a photo of themselves and then analyze the photo to show them which pet would be the best fit for them. 
Based on the results, the AI robot will tell you the two best things about the pet and three tips to prepare before welcoming it into the family.
