# Find-the-best-matching-pet
I won the overall winner award in the 2023 Yhack hackathon competition! 

<h1>The web app I created</h1>
The theme of the Yhack this year was "identity" and "AI". I created a fun and quick facial recognition web app. 
Apps that recognize faces and analyze facial shapes have been popular in Korea since smartphones first became popular. 
However, after living in the United States for five years, I didn't see many people talking about these kinds of apps, 
so I wondered how I could introduce them to people in a friendly way. I remembered that many people in the U.S. have pets and treat 
them like family members, so I thought they would be interested in an app that would show them which pet would be the best match 
based on the user's face shape. This is an app that allows users to upload a photo of themselves and then analyze the photo to show
them which pet would be the best fit for them. Based on the results, the AI robot will tell you the two best things about the pet and 
three tips to prepare before welcoming it into the family.

<h2>The reasons this app is a good fit for the themes of this Yhack, "Identity" and "AI"</h2>
<p>1. Nowadays, pets are not just animals, they have a bigger meaning and help many people to learn about happiness and pleasure. Pets are people's best friends and family members. Therefore, pets are grateful friends who help people realize their identity.</p>
<p>2. Many people grow up with pets from a young age. They learn to be responsible, learn to love others and learn to respect others. That is why pets help people learn their identity.</p>  
<p>3. we had to train the model to recognize and analyze faces and use OpenAI to generate answers based on the results. These two characteristics give users the opportunity to interact with AI beyond just having fun.</p>
<p>4. and this is just fun! We don't have to be so serious about identity. Sometimes the chance to have a little fun and be happy can be the thing that keeps our own healthy identity.</p>

<h2>The technology/resource I used</h2>
  <h3>-- Teachable Machine<h3>
    <p>Teachable Machine is an online platform that allows users to train their own machine learning models without any coding knowledge. Users can create custom image, sound, or gesture recognition models by providing examples of what they want the model to identify. The platform is easy to use, and the resulting models can be exported for use in a variety of applications.</p>

  <h3>-- Codepen<h3>
    <p>This is a life saver for web developer and UI/UX designers! A lot of asweome people share HTML/Javascript/CSS forms that they created. You will find great designs and ideas here!</p>

  <h3>-- Addthis<h3>
    <p>This is a quick and helpful website that you can create share function! If you would like to create a feature that users can share the app/link with others through social media, this will save your time! You don't have to get every single API for each platfrom. Simply use this website, and this will create code line for you. What you need to is just to copy and paste it to your code!</p>

<h2>Things that I can improve</h2>
<p>1. When I click "try with another picture" button, it successfully reload the page. However, when I try to analyze picture for the second time, it loads previous result AND the the current result.</p>
<p>2. I wanted to add some features in the navigation bar. However, I thought it was not a main feature of this app, so I didn't implement it.</p>
<p>3. It takes a few seconds to generate the result. I believe that there is a way to optimize this app to reduce the time complexity.</p>
<p>4. I could improve design part of this app such as the section that chat GPT returns the result, graph bars, image section size, etc </p>
    
<h2>Overall</h2>
    <p>I spent 24 hours making this app and learned a lot. First, brainstorming. I spent 2 hours on this part alone. I thought a lot about what kind of program I could create by combining Identity and AI. In the process, I thought about what the users need, how to reach them easily, and what message I want to share. As a programmer, I learned that it is important to code well, but it is also very important to capture the needs and wants of users. Secondly, I learned how to incorporate machine learning and AI into my ideas. AI has already made a lot of progress, and some people think that it will replace programmers altogether. However, I don't think AI will replace the emotional part. I can't wait to see the effects and results of combining the strengths of AI with human emotion. Creating this app has made me think a lot about how we can combine the strengths of AI with the strengths of humans in the future. Finally, I had the experience that my program can deliver a message to someone. When I gave my presentation and allowed the judges to use my app on their own smartphones, they were really excited. It's a great feeling to know that your skills can bring happiness and benefit to someone!</p>
